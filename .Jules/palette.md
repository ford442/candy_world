## 2026-01-01 - Dynamic Toggle Labels
**Learning:** Static labels on toggle buttons (e.g., "Toggle Day/Night") force users to infer the result. Changing the label and icon to reflect the *current* state (e.g., "☀️ Day Mode") provides immediate confirmation and reduces cognitive load, especially when the visual change (e.g., lighting) might be subtle or delayed.
**Action:** When implementing toggle buttons, prefer dynamic labels that explicitly state the current mode over generic "Toggle" verbs.
