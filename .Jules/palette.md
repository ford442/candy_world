## 2024-05-22 - Actionable Empty States
**Learning:** Empty states in modal dialogs (like the Jukebox) are often dead ends. Users were forced to scan for a separate "Add" button. Converting the empty state message itself into an actionable button reduces cognitive load and click distance.
**Action:** Always verify if an "empty state" message can be converted into a direct call-to-action for the primary solution (e.g., "Add Item").
