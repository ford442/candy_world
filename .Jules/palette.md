## 2024-05-22 - Actionable Empty States
**Learning:** Empty states in modal dialogs (like the Jukebox) are often dead ends. Users were forced to scan for a separate "Add" button. Converting the empty state message itself into an actionable button reduces cognitive load and click distance.
**Action:** Always verify if an "empty state" message can be converted into a direct call-to-action for the primary solution (e.g., "Add Item").

## 2024-05-23 - Consistent Keyboard Shortcuts
**Learning:** Users expect common actions (like Mute) to have standard keyboard shortcuts ('M'). When a UI button exists for a toggle, it should almost always have a corresponding hotkey, and that hotkey should be visible in the button label to aid discovery.
**Action:** Ensure all toggle buttons in the main HUD have associated keyboard shortcuts and display them (e.g., "Mute (M)").
