## 2024-05-23 - Visual Consistency in Typography
**Learning:** The "Candy" aesthetic relies heavily on the "Fredoka One" font for its playful, rounded look. However, standard UI elements (headings in the pause menu and jukebox) were defaulting to system fonts (`Segoe UI`), creating a visual disconnect.
**Action:** Always verify that branding fonts are applied consistently across all UI layers, especially in modal overlays that sit on top of the 3D world. Consolidating font usage (e.g., in `index.html`) is a low-cost, high-impact visual polish.
